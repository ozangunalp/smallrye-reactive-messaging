# SmallRye Reactive Messaging

**SmallRye Reactive Messaging is a framework for building event-driven, data streaming, and event-sourcing applications.**

It lets your application interact using various messaging technologies such as Apache Kafka, AMQP or MQTT.
The framework provides a flexible programming model bridging [CDI](https://www.cdi-spec.org/) and event-driven.

SmallRye Reactive Messaging is an implementation of the Eclipse MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification {{ attributes['spec-version'] }}.
